# NBT Viewer

**The current version is a work in progress, and is not intended for use
in mod packs.**

## Usage

There is a configurable key bind - Right ALT by default - which opens the 
NBT Viewer GUI.

Inside the GUI, there will be key-value pairs for each element of the data.
For Lists, the index in the list is the key.

Object keys are sorted by name.
