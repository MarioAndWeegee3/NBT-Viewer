# NBT Viewer

## Usage

There is a configurable key bind - Right ALT by default - which opens the 
NBT Viewer GUI.

Inside the GUI, there will be key-value pairs for each element of the data.
For Lists, the index in the list is the key.

Object keys are sorted by name.

## Changelog

### Version 3.0.0

* Ported to 1.20.1
* All elements are represented by a button. For types other than lists and objects, this button does nothing and is
purely decorative.
